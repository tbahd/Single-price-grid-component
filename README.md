## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to work with css grid on a real project and also found out cool stuff in regards to layouts.

```css
main {
        width: 50%;
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
        grid-template-rows: 200px 230px;
      }
```

### Continued development

I'm going to continue learning how to properly create layouts using css grid.
